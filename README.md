# SocialMediaApp

# Motivation

I wanted to further my understanding of building a full-stack MERN application. This project also introduced me to GraphQL and how it is used in a real world setting. I didn't expect to learn as much as I did from this project but the complexity of creating something like this is actually pretty surprising. This project also helped fortify my knowledge of JS and React pretty well which I was surprised by. Things like destructuring, useState and useContext were used quite a bit throughout this project which are very important topics to understand and while I was comfortable before with using them I feel like I understand them much better now.
